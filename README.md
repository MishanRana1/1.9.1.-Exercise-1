# 1.9.1.-Exercise-1
Create Person and PersonTester classes to model a person. Details are as follows:

Tasks: Create business class Person
Person should have the following properties (attributes, instance variables, member variables). Pick appropriate data types:

name – stores the full name of a person

age – stores age of a person in whole years

eyeColor – stores the color of a person’s eyes

Create a no-argument constructor for this class

In the constructor for the Person class, use your information to initialize the instance variables

Create a 3-arg constructor that initializes the instance variables to passed parameters

Create getters/accessors for each instance variable

Create setters/mutators for each instance variable

Override the toString() method to return a clear message providing details of each person.

Create instance method talk() that prints a message “Welcome, coders! I am ”, underline should be replaced by the person’s name. It does not need any parameters and does not return any values.

Tasks: Create tester class PersonTester
In the main() method, create an object of class Person called person1 using the no-argument constructor.

SOP person1 details using toString().

Invoke the appropriate setter method to set/change the name of person1 to “Howard Roark”.

Invoke the talk() method on person1.

Ensure that all of your code is thoroughly commented.
